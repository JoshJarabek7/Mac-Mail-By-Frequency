# Mac-Mail-By-Frequency

## Sort Mail by sender frequency and tackle the worst spam first using the Mac OS Mail app.

<br>

*I'm sitting here right now paranoid because I had an incredibly important email that got buried by the daily spam. Not wanting this to ever happen again, I decided that it was time to filter out the spam and make rules for my mailbox. Unfortunately, my inbox has over 30,000 unread emails. I just created it two years ago, because the same thing happened to my other email. I'm not going to keep creating new email accounts, so I decided to take on the task, one by one, of which email addresses to move to junk.*

<br>

**This is how it was going:**

<br>

  1. Going from most recent emails, I see an email that's spam (nearly the entire screen).
  2. I copy that email address, search it, and move all emails from them to spam.
  3. 29,991 unread emails left
  4. Repeat

<br>

After about 5 minutes, I realized...**this is going to take all night**.

<br>

I thought *"this would be way easier if I could just tackle the ones that email me the most, and then I could do the less frequent ones as they come in over time"*.


<br>
<br>
<br>

So I googled *"how do I sort my Mac Mail inboxes by frequency"*.

<br>

*...not a built in feature*.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Then I thought, *"oh, there's probably something for that in the app store"*.

<br>

*...nope*

<br>
<br>
<br>

Then I thought, *"oh, there's probably something for that on GitHub"*.

<br>

*...found one!...its last update was...*
**6 years ago...**
*not even gonna try it*.

<br>
<br>
<br>

There's probably a solution out there that costs money. But why spend money when you could **not spend money instead**?

<br>

I don't really know Swift, but I've always wanted to learn it.

<br>

No better time than right now.

<br>

**It's time to take back our mailboxes!**
